PHP classes added to this directory (/site/src) will be loaded instead of classes in the root src directory (/src). This lets you overwrite classes included with the Another MVC framework to implement your own versions.

If you want to modify Another MVC classes, it is recommended you first copy them to this directory (/site/src) and then modify them. If problems arise, you will then still have access to the original classes for troubleshooting with comparison.
