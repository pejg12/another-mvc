== Readme ==

This is a ''readme'' file using the '''mediawiki''' markup.

 This is a pre block
 with multiple lines

* Fruits
** Apple
** Banana
* Cars
** Convertible
** Van

And here is a link to an [http://example.org external website].

== Conclusion ==

It definitely seems to work, but.. Why is the h1 a link? Did I break something? Let's start with a h2 like Wikipedia tells us to.

Let's see how advanced this is...

{|
! Header
! Header
|-
| Row 1
| Column 2
|- 
| Column 1
| Row 2
|}

If the above is output as a table with both th and td, this is one happy camper indeed.
